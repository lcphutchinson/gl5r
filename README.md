# GL5R Development Documentation

"Game Lieutenant" is a programmable toolsuite for authors of tabletop roleplaying games operating on the Discord social media platform. Its objective is to deliver four interconnected services--Character Data Storage, Game System Data Storage, Resolver Management, and Scene Management--as defined by "Game Systems" created and customized by authors using the Game Lieutenant web API.

"GL5R" is a requirements elicitation project and prototype of Game Lieutenant's Services components using Fantasy Flight Games' 'Legend of the Five Rings' Roleplaying game as its underlying system. 

Development is still in its earliest stages, so documentation \(including this Readme\) will be sparse until I verify the workability of my architecture.
